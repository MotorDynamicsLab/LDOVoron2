# Nozzle scrubber
Our kits provide a brass brush which you can use to convert to a nozzle scrubber using this [mod](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/main/orphaned_mods/edwardyeeks/Decontaminator_Purge_Bucket_%26_Nozzle_Scrubber).
Since our build plate sits higher than typical voron beds, you should use modified files here.
