# COB Light Strip Mount
This mount is an easy and fast to print mount for COB (chip on the board) LED strips which are included in LDO Voron kits starting from Rev.D. These LED strips have built-in light diffusion which produces a softer lighting effect for your printer. The STLs come in three sizes (50/100/150mm) that allow you to combine into a length you need for your LED strip. The provided Fusion 360 source file is parametric to allow for any arbitrary length for the mount. The following are recommend print counts for different Voron kits.
